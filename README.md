# heterogeneous-agent-computing

A repository for the Heterogeneous-Agents Computing (HAC) project. This project aims to create a simple modular framework which can execute and estimate any heterogeneous-agent model in the economics literature. The goal is lofty but we believe a multi-pronged effort (which emphasizes innovative incentives for open collaboration) will make it a reality.

**Update:** The next generation version of this project now resides here: https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK Please find more about the project here: https://econ-ark.org
